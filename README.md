Run and jump to the end. If you fall, the level restarts.

## What this is
The game’s called *Jumpstart Cat on the Beach*. You play as a cat hopping across platforms over the ocean. Don’t fall, make it to the end! 

## Why I made it
I wanted to try building a small but finished game to practice Godot and game design to be able to help with organizing Daydream Cleveland. Plus, it counts for the Athena Award, so it gave me another good reason to actually ship something cool.

## How I made it
I used Godot. Started with a basic movement + jump script, added collisions, then built out a beachy level with floating platforms. Outside of tutorial, I added the beach background, respawn, and my own design. This was my first time making a game.

## Struggles + what I learned
Biggest struggle was getting the jump to feel right. It was either too floaty or too stiff for a while. Also figuring out how to reset the level without breaking stuff. Main thing I learned: even a small game takes way more tweaking than you’d think.

## Controls
- **Move:** Left / Right (Arrow keys)  
- **Jump:** Space 

## How to play
- Stay on the platforms  
- Reach the goal at the end  
- Falling off restarts the level
